# Udacity-Neighbourhood-Map

## Project Overview
We will develop a single page application featuring a map of our neighborhood or a neighborhood we would like to visit. It is using FoureSquare API's to highlight the nearby Food center in the map.

## APIs
Google Maps API is used here to show the map and generate the markers etc.
Foursquare API is used to pull more information on my favorite locations and provide a more complete listing when you click on the marker and the infoWindow shows up.
